Overview
========

`A Better Routeplanner (ABRP) <https://abetterrouteplanner.com>`_ is an electric
vehicle (EV) focussed route planner that incorporates planning of EV charging
stops.

The OVMS plugin sends live telemetry data from the vehicle to ABRP to be used
for the route planning process and appropriate updates to the plan along the way
based on live information.

Refer to the installation instructions at the `Internio ovms-link repo
